Question 1
1. Use ps to search for the “systemd” process by name.
2. Find out your terminal name.Using your terminal name, use ps to find all processes associated
With your terminal.
3. Check and note the process id of your shell(from the output of the above command).
Also, note the parent process id of your shell.
4. Start 3 instances of “sleep 123” as background processes.
5. Check and note the process id’s of all sleep processes.
6. Display only those three sleep processes in top. Then quit top.

The kernel identifies each process using a process ID (PID), a every instance of process must have a unique PID from other processes which is assigned when the process is invoked, to avoid any execution errors.

The /proc file system stores information about currently running processes on your system, it contains directories for each process.

Use the ls command to list its contents, however, the list may be long, so employ a pipeline and the less utility to view the /proc contents in a more convenient way as below:

From the screenshot above, the numbered directories store information files about the processes in execution, where each number corresponds to a PID.

Below is the list of files for systemd process with PID 1:
